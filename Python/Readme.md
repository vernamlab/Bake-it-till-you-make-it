# The code provided here is to calculate TVLA and DPA for traces available in the SCApegoat file format. [SCApeGoat](https://github.com/vernamlab/SCApeGoat).
The main functions with examples are provided in the TVLA_DPA.ipynb. This will give a user the base for calculating metrics. The actual methods are stored in functions notebook while the DPA and FileFormat python files are taken from the SCApegoat repository (to remove the need for learning to install or clone the whole github library).
